# team-scriptlgnds-backend

# This is the backend portion of a project that was worked on by myself and three other classmates that attended Bethel School of Technology. We decided to make a game reviewing site where you can come a see details about various video games and review them based on what you thought of the game.

While we never really got too far into the development of this website, me and my teammates made a good effort to get this functional to the point where it could be used. While it isn't super useful as is, it does go to show that we learned a lot and tried our best with it.
